In this page, 
we share our traces on user-generated videos for the wider community use. 
Our traces include meta-information about videos from 
<A href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a>
and <A href="http://ucc.daum.net">Daum</a> services.
We provide snapshot of all videos in some of their video categories. 
For more information on the traces,
