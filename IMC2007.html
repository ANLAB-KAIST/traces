User Generated Content (UGC) is re-shaping the way people
watch video and TV, with millions of video producers and
consumers. In particular, UGC sites are creating new viewing 
patterns and social interactions, empowering users to be
more creative, and developing new business opportunities.
To better understand the impact of UGC systems, we have
analyzed YouTube, the world's largest UGC VoD system.
Based on a large amount of data collected, we provide an
in-depth study of YouTube and other similar UGC systems.
In particular, we study the popularity life-cycle of videos,
the intrinsic statistical properties of requests and their 
relationship with video age, and the level of content aliasing
or of illegal content in the system. We also provide insights
on the potential for more efficient UGC VoD systems (e.g.,
utilizing P2P techniques or making better use of caching).
Finally, we discuss the opportunities to leverage the latent
demand for niche videos that are not reached today due to
information filtering effects or other system scarcity distortions. 
Overall, we believe that the results presented in this
paper are crucial in understanding UGC systems and can
provide valuable information to ISPs, site administrators,
and content owners with major commercial and technical
implications.
